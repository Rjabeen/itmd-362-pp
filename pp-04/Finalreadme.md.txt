# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage

* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Login information is hidden on the side, and main page is filled with lots of stuff , which is distrating to the users.
you have to pay close attention to navigate to the login info. I guess Android bottom navigation for mobile devices would work 
better for IIT webpage


* HCI Guidline Two (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-system
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
IIT webpage background can be light blue, with text in black and text field in grey color.Log in button can be ark grey.Top 
part of the header can stay as it is.


* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/errors.html#errors-user-input-errors
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
when user inputs incorrect information, then error text can be displayed in different color like red.
Clearly explain the errors to the user, and ask them to reenter the information correctly.
